# Contributing to EcoForge

Welcome! We're building open-source closed-loop AI homesteads powered by Grok (reasoning & vetoes), Optimus (automation), and Starship (scaling/logistics). Earth abundance prototypes now, Mars readiness later. Humanity first: flip consumption → create/produce/provide.

## How to Contribute
- **Fork & PR**: Make changes → commit clearly → open a pull request to `main`.
- **Focus Areas** (especially now with Grok 4.20 dropping this week):
  - Prompt optimizations & deepened chains for Grok 4.20 reasoning/agentic boosts
  - xAI API integrations (tool calling, real-time X/web data, multimodal vision)
  - Sim improvements (aquaponics/vermiponics, energy, expansion Monte Carlo)
  - Multimodal stubs (image/video analysis for Node designs/regolith)
  - Bug fixes, logging enhancements, documentation
- **Data Collection**: Run sims with Grok 4.20 → share outputs/logs in issues or PRs (JSON, screenshots, metrics, anonymized results). Helps us compound knowledge.
- **Good First Issues**: Coming soon—watch for labels like `grok-4.20`, `help-wanted`, `good-first-issue`.
- **Questions or Ideas?** Open an issue or DM @SeanSestina on X.

## Process
1. Fork the repo
2. Create a branch (e.g., `feature/grok-4.20-api-example`)
3. Make changes & commit with clear messages
4. Open a PR with a description of what you added/why

G Family Rules: Family first, share improvements openly, build for abundance and resilience.

Thanks for helping forge the future! 🚀🌱🪐
