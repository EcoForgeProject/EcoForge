# Phase 1: Digital Foundation & Simulation Forge (✅ Completed / In Final Polish)

## Goal
Lock in all blueprints, simulations, API endpoints, Grok/Ara integration plans, and open-source readiness **before** any physical container build.  
Create a fully documented, forkable, Grok-accelerated foundation that proves 95–96.5% resource recovery on paper (and in sims) for both Earth homesteads and Mars analogs.

**Target End State:** Anyone can clone the repo, run the simulations, understand the closed-loop flows, and start contributing or replicating safely.

## Detailed Checklist

### 1. Core Blueprints & Documentation
- [x] Finalize v3 "Supernova" blueprint with full metrics (95–96.5% recovery, NH₃ <6 ppm, RO at 0.55 kWh/m³, 18.8 LMH flux, 400+ lbs/month food surplus for 10-person node)
- [x] Complete Master-BOM-All-Tiers.md with sourcing notes, cost tiers, and exploded views
- [x] Document full system flows (vermiponics → biogas → RO → energy storage) in designs/ and images/
- [x] Create 2500sqft-Home-Floor-Plan.md with ecosystem layout and engineering hub placement
- [x] Add Hub-Fab-Tools.md (CNC, 3D printer, Optimus-ready fab notes)
- [x] Write complete-v1.1-master-protocol-list.md for operational governance
- [ ] Add any missing visuals (isometric views, nutrient/energy flow diagrams) to /images/

### 2. Simulations & Modeling
- [x] Build and validate ODE-based vermiponics nutrient cycle simulation (sim-aquaponics-nutrient-cycle.py)
- [x] Integrate RO model with energy calculations (target: 0.55 kWh/m³)
- [x] Test biogas integration points and ammonia control (<6 ppm)
- [x] Run sensitivity analyses (winter surplus, different scales, Mars regolith analogs)
- [x] Document assumptions, limitations, and how real-world results may differ (link to DISCLAIMER.md)
- [ ] Add orbital solar placeholder simulations (Orbital Solar/v0.1) if relevant for Mars tie-in

### 3. API & Tooling
- [x] Deploy FastAPI /simulate endpoint for vermiponic + RO ODEs (with throttling)
- [x] Add requirements.txt and quick-start instructions in README
- [x] Create sensor logging stubs (grok_esp32_logger_stub.py)
- [x] Build basic chaos engineering examples in chaos-examples/
- [ ] Add more endpoints (e.g., energy balance, alarm thresholds)

### 4. Grok & AI Integration (Ara Voice Agents)
- [x] Create Grok-Ara-Integration-Plan.md (reasoning for sim tuning, realtime voice, tool calling)
- [x] Prepare my-prompt.md and test prompts for warm, conversational Ara agents
- [x] Set up xAI API key and test basic calls (awaiting credits top-up for heavy usage)
- [x] Outline Grok agent roles: sim explainer, optimizer, safety monitor, operator guide
- [ ] Develop ForgeHub-UI-Concept.md (live dashboard for pH, TDS, energy, flow)
- [ ] Implement initial Grok tool-calling stubs for realtime closed-loop adjustments

### 5. Safety, Legal & Open-Source Readiness
- [x] Add full ⚠️ SAFETY & LIABILITY DISCLAIMER to README.md, DISCLAIMER.md, CONTRIBUTING.md, Master-BOM, simulations, and all docs
- [x] Update LICENSE (MIT) and SECURITY.md
- [x] Write clear CONTRIBUTING.md with risk acknowledgment
- [ ] Add Code of Conduct if community growth accelerates
- [ ] Ensure every major file links back to DISCLAIMER.md

### 6. Traction & Community Prep
- [ ] Draft initial X thread templates announcing the repo (with disclaimer call-out)
- [ ] Create onboarding guide for new contributors (fork → run sim → suggest improvements)
- [ ] Document Phase 1 completion evidence (screenshots of running sims/API)
- [ ] Prepare pitch for land scouts / family (Cambridge I-70/I-77 node context)

## Status & Notes (March 2026)
- **Overall Phase 1 Status:** Largely Complete — Blueprints locked, sims/API live, disclaimers armored.
- **Remaining Polish Items:** Grok credits top-up, extra UI concepts, full visual set, and final validation runs.
- **Blockers:** xAI API credits for deeper Ara testing; site confirmation for transition to Phase 2.
- **Success Metrics:** Repo is forkable, simulations reproducible, disclaimers protect everyone, and Grok integration plan is actionable.

**⚠️ See full [DISCLAIMER.md](../DISCLAIMER.md) before any work or forking.**  
All simulations are models only — real-world performance requires professional engineering review and code compliance.

Let's forge the digital foundation solid so Phase 2 (physical container) hits the ground running. ❤️🥷🌱🪐♾️
