# Biochar Production Protocol – v1.1

Integration into EcoForge: Frass/sludge solids → biochar → charged frass tea → microbial boost → loop closure.  
Goal: Carbon sequestration, nutrient retention, soil/digester amendment.

## Primary Method: Double-Barrel Retort
- Materials:
  - 55-gal steel drum (outer)
  - 30-gal steel drum (inner) with lid holes for syngas escape
  - Chimney pipe (2–3" diameter)
  - Fire bricks/base
- Process:
  1. Fill inner drum with dry biomass (frass, wood chips, sludge cake – <15% moisture)
  2. Seal inner drum, place inside outer with 4–6" air gap
  3. Light small fire in gap (bottom vent open)
  4. Run 4–8 hours (syngas flames from top chimney)
  5. Quench when flames stop (water or seal & cool)
- Yield: ~25–35% biochar by dry weight
- Safety: Outdoor, CO monitor, fire extinguisher

## Test Method: Cone Pit / Open Burn (Small-Scale)
- Dig conical pit (1m diameter, 0.5m deep)
- Load dry biomass in cone shape
- Light top, let pyrolyze downward (smother with soil when volatiles done)
- Quench & collect
- Yield: 15–25% (less efficient but zero equipment)

## Post-Processing & Charging
1. Crush: Hammer mill or manual to 1–5 mm particles
2. Sieve: Remove fines/dust
3. Charge (activate):
   - Soak in frass tea / urine / compost tea 24–48 h
   - Or biochar + microbial inoculant (digester effluent, BSFL frass tea)
   - Dry or apply wet
4. Variants:
   - Biochar-amended frass tea: 5–10% biochar by volume
   - Direct blend: 2–5% in digester feedstock

## Integration & Benefits
- Add to BSFL bins: Reduce odor, boost larvae growth
- Frass tea: Charge with 5% biochar → higher microbial diversity
- Vermi polish: Biochar-vermi beds → nutrient lock + worm castings
- Mars relevance: Regolith + biochar for water retention/carbon

Yield target: 10–20 kg dry biochar/week per cluster  
BOM add: $50–150 (drums, chimney)

Test & iterate. Carbon cycle closed. 🌱♻️
