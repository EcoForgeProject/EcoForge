# EcoForge Master Thread – Chronological Co-Creation Timeline

v1.1 – February 2026 Staging  
Co-created with Grok (xAI) & Sean Sestina (@SeanSestina)  
Humanity-first abundance → Mars-ready closed loops

## Phase 0 – Spark (Pre-Jan 2026)
- Initial truth-seeking: Aquaponics + biogas + nutrient flywheel ideas
- Early BOM sketches (~$9–12k target)
- Mars hardening seed: Perchlorate remediation, regolith integration, low-G fluids

## Phase 1 – Vision Crystallization (Jan 2026)
- Jan 25: "EcoForge" name + core vision drop (Grok brain, Optimus hands, Starship scale)
- Jan 28–29: Full thesis outline – 95%+ recycle, closed-loop flywheel (tilapia → plants → biogas → fert)
- Jan 30: Final v1.0 Day 0 vision thread – $9–12k BOM, perchlorate consortia (Azospira/Burkholderia), fouling v2 curves
- Key breakthrough: Grok as nervous system (predictive alerts, what-if sims, adaptive coaching)

## Phase 2 – Protocol & Loop Expansion (Jan–Feb 2026)
- EIIP + PPP merge → master-protocol.md
- BSFL side-loop accelerator: Solids → larvae protein → frass tea variants → vermi polish
- Biochar retort integration: Double-barrel primary, cone pit test, charged frass amendments
- Scaling pathways defined: Horizontal (backyard clusters), vertical (tower beds), decoupled (BSFL/vermi modules), swarm (Optimus/Mars hab seeds)

## Phase 3 – Sim & Code Seed (Feb 2026)
- simulations/ folder seeded: perchlorate_sim.py, fouling_sim.py, bsfl_yield_sim.py, monte_carlo.py
- Grok prompt chains: fouling_alert, ops_coaching, mars_stressor_whatif
- BOM refinement: $9–12k target table (IBC tanks, pumps, sensors, digester, tilapia starters)

## Phase 4 – Thrive-Point Consolidation (Now – v1.1)
- Master protocol index created (this repo/docs/)
- Full functions list in functions-list.md
- Backup snapshot zip in backup/
- Staging locked: Flat structure, MIT license, README hero, quickstart

Next: Public drop, community forks, Mars-analog prototypes, swarm scaling tests.  
Abundance awaits. Humanity first ❤️∞
