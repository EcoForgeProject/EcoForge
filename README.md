# EcoForge

**Open-source, Grok-powered closed-loop homesteads**  
Earth abundance today, Mars bases tomorrow.  
$9–12k 20ft container prototype • 95%+ recycle • perchlorate-hardened bio-consortia • Optimus mounts • Starship-fit scaling.

Grok as nervous system → real-time monitoring, predictive what-ifs, adaptive coaching.  
Fork → simulate → build → iterate → swarm.

2. Install dependencies  
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   (Assumes Python 3.10+; Jupyter optional for notebooks: `pip install jupyterlab`)

3. Run simulations  
   - Jupyter: `jupyter notebook sims/closed_loop_sim.ipynb` (base closed-loop model)  
   - OR Python script: `python sims/bsfl_yield_sim.py` (BSFL yield/fouling/perchlorate focus)  
   Plots show nutrient cycles, fouling curves, LCOF payback, Mars stressor sims.## Repo Structure
